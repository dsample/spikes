# Client-side data sharing approaches

## JSONP

JSONP is just a `script` tag which points to a JavaScript file hosted on the resource's domain. As long as the script is designed well (scoped variables).

Add the line '127.0.0.1 example.com example.net example.org` to your Hosts file.

Run `bundle install` to install the gems you need in order to run it. Then to start the server run `ruby server.rb` or `sudo server.rg` (if the first fails with unauthorised).
